## Actions
### How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
One can empower themself in a digital world by educating themselves on technology. By knowing the risks and benefits of technology, one will be able to thrive in the digital world.

### How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by helping them have access to the digital world. For example, some parts of the world are too poor to afford internet or up-to-date technology, therefore they are behind in the digital world. Something you could do at DNHS is helping those who are struggling to use their devices properly.

### Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
Red tape is blocking digital empowerment because it is censoring materials that could be used for good purposes, such as education. At DNHS, there are such barriers because there are wifi restrictions on what websites students can acess. Another exmple of digital censorship is in China, as they are blocking social websites such as youtube and facebook.
